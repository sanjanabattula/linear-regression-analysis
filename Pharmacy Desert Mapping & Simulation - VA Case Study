Pharmacy Desert Mapping & Simulation — Virginia Case Study
This project identifies and visualizes pharmacy deserts across Virginia, using geospatial and demographic data to assess disparities in access to pharmacy services—especially among veterans, rural residents, and low-income communities. Conducted in collaboration with VCU School of Pharmacy and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the results were published in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association and informed state-level healthcare policy, including use by the Governor of Virginia.

📌 Project Goals
Classify areas as pharmacy deserts based on spatial and socioeconomic criteria

Quantify disparities in pharmacy access by demographics and geography

Simulate optimal pharmacy placement using Monte Carlo methods

Provide policymakers with a data-driven tool for strategic resource allocation

🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
Language: R

Key Packages: sf, dplyr, ggplot2, tidycensus, tigris, ggmap, data.table

Visualization: Custom heatmaps, spatial overlays

Statistical Methods: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, subgroup analysis

Simulation: Monte Carlo framework (10,000+ iterations)

🧪 Methodology
Data Integration

Virginia Board of Pharmacy facility data

2022 American Community Survey (ACS) demographic data (tract-level)

Urban/rural classifications via Census geography

Pharmacy Desert Definition

Deserts defined by:

Low-income threshold (based on ACS)

Distance to nearest pharmacy (1, 5, or 10 miles depending on urbanicity)

Geospatial Modeling

Used the sf package to calculate Euclidean and road network distances from census tract centroids to pharmacy locations

Classified pharmacy deserts and mapped them using ggplot2

Simulation Engine

Ran 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to place potential pharmacy sites in desert regions

Measured population “rescued” from desert status per iteration

Developed population-weighted impact scoring to rank optimal locations

Equity & Disparity Analysis

Used Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to compare desert vs. non-desert tracts

Conducted subgroup analysis on race, insurance status, income, and age

📊 Results
~15% of Virginia’s VA-enrolled population lives in pharmacy deserts

Disproportionate impact on rural residents, racial/ethnic minorities, and low-income groups

Identified 44 high-impact zones for potential pharmacy placement—each benefiting 10,000+ residents

🏆 Impact
Peer-reviewed publication in the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association

Used by the Deputy Executive Director of the Virginia Board of Pharmacy

Informed Governor-level health equity initiatives in Virginia
